# Audit Reports

Our smart contracts have been audited by [Hacken](https://hacken.io/) and [CredShields](https://www.credshields.com/). The resulting reports are located next to this file. Please note:

- The original audits have been based on our [Staking Contracts](https://github.com/w3labsxyz/ethereum-staking-contracts), which included a staking rewards contract in addition to the permissionless batch deposit contract located in this repository. The contracts in this repository are a subset of the original audit scope.
- The original audits have been commissioned by "Justfarming", the name of the legal entity that "w3.labs" was spinned off of.
